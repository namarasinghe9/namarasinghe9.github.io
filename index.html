<p>I lead a small team at <a href="https://www.tesla.com/AI">Tesla AI</a> working on AI Infrastructure for self-driving and humanoid robotics.</p>

<p>I am interested in the entire AI Infra stack from training, inference, machine learning compilers and HW accelerators. I am fortunate enough to work on all of these pieces regularly.</p>

<p>Previously I worked at Apple on the iPhone and before that at NVIDIA on power and perf optimization for datacenter GPUs.</p>

<p>I received an M.S and B.S in Engineering Science from University of Toronto. While there I did research on high-speed chip-to-chip communication <a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/74501/3/Amarasinghe_Nadeesha_201611_MAS_thesis.pdf">thesis</a>.</p>
